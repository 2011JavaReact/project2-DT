# What Is Barker?
Barker is a full stack web application that enables shelters to input dogs available for adoption. These dogs can be viewed, ‘liked’, and ‘disliked’ by users interested in adopting a dog. Users can create an account, input their dog preferences, view a series of dogs that match their preferences, and view all previously ‘liked’ dogs. They can also view a series of dogs one at a time, and, if one chooses to ‘swipe’ left, that dog will not be shown again. If they ‘swipe’ right, that dog will be added to the list of ‘liked’ dogs that are viewable on a separate ‘liked dogs’ page. Users can also request adoption of a particular dog which will put them in contact with the applicable shelter. Through this app, shelters can create an account and create dog profiles that are viewable by a user. If a dog gets adopted, the shelter can modify the dog profile to show that the dog is now adopted.
